  * **Descrição da tarefa e resultados esperados**:

This task focuses on further improving the DENDRO prototype in order to make it a building block for a federation of repositories targeted at researchers'  daily data management processes. Its goal is to broaden DENDRO's existing researcher user base through a perception of added value; As a result, it will be possible to gather feedback (implicit and explicit) from those users, in order to support research contributions in at least three research domains: data preservation, metadata and semantics research and semantic web.

The DENDRO prototype will be complemented with a zero-configuration distributed (peer-to-peer) module, extending it to support automatic discovery of other repository instances through the BitTorrent protocol (drawing inspiration from the Academic Torrents project) and federated querying (either directly via the  SPARQL endpoints provided by Virtuoso, its underlying graph database, or through the platform's comprehensive API). In the preservation community, such an approach would be a decentralized, non privately controlled cloud-based solution for storing, searching and retrieving all types of research data---borrowing the concepts introduced by the LOCKSS infrastructure for research publication preservation and extending them to research datasets. 

Designing application profiles capable of satisfying the data description needs of researchers is not a trivial task; these domain-targeted sets of descriptors need to be comprehensive enough to ensure the discovery and comprehension of the assets, but simple enough to reduce the time invested by researchers in the description of their data to the minimum necessary. Having curators manually design an application profile for every research domain in existence is an impossible task, especially when the goal is to shorten the time gap between the production of the dataset and its deposit and initial description by the researcher. Thus, there is the need to automate, at least partially, the generation of these application profiles.

In the metadata and semantics research domain, these proposed features are regarded as a way to broaden the existing panel of test users for DENDRO. This wider user base will then be the main source of user feedback for improving DENDRO's semi-automated application profile generation, complementing its partially automated metadata production capabilities. DENDRO's existing user behaviour monitoring features---which are already in place in the prototype and were designed with the goal of gathering information about descriptor usage by researchers---will be used for dynamically building the necessary application profiles, while providing suggestions for the possible values of those descriptors, in an effort to reduce the time spent by researchers in their data description tasks. Evaluation will focus of user studies, comparing the time invested in the production of metadata records without and with the inclusion of semi-automation features; the resulting metadata records will also be subjected to peer review to evaluate their quality. Researchers from the same domains that will not participate in the production of the metadata records will be asked to evaluate the records produced by their peers in the two scenarios.

Contributions in the field of the semantic web will focus improving the interlinking of DENDRO's LOD metadata records with the semantic web; the problem can be divided into two sub-tasks: increasing the number of ingoing links and outgoing links that link from/to existing resources on the semantic web.

In order to increase the number of outbound links specified DENDRO metadata records, information from existing generic LOD sources such as Freebase, DBPedia, DrugBank, the US Congress Directory can be harvested and used to provide suggestions for the values of descriptors. A possible example scenario would be the automatic suggestion of mollecules as the possible values for a "Studied substance" descriptor, used in chemistry datasets. The list of molecules would be drawn from an existing source, such as DBPedia. Upon de-referentiation of the metadata record, an human user would see a human-readable representation of that molecule in the DENDRO interface (such as "Glucose", the corresponding "rdfs:label" instance), internally the system would record an URI to the DBpedia resource instead ("http://live.dbpedia.org/page/Glucose"). This would greatly improve the richness of the metadata recorded in the DENDRO instances by uniquely identifying each concept used in the metadata record, instead of relying on the researcher's ability to correctly fill in the values. 

In order to increase the number of inbound links that point to DENDRO records, it is necessary to increase their visibility. To achieve this, we will build on the experience gathered during the development of the Lod4All project, a portal designed for showcasing LOD records from generic-domain sources (e.g. DBPedia, Freebase) as well as domain-specific (e.g. DailyMed, Project Gutenberg) through a single interface. By integrating LOD4All with DENDRO, LOD4All will become a data record browser that will help DENDRO public datasets to gain visibility on the semantic web.
